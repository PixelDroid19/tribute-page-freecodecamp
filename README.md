This project is a tribute page for the "Tribute Page" challenge on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to showcase my web development skills, particularly in HTML and CSS. Additionally, this project allows me to practice responsive web design and organizing content on the page.
